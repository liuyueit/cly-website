To connect the front end of your eCommerce website (the HTML pages we've created so far) to the back end, you'll need a server-side platform to handle requests, manage databases, and process data. Below, I'll guide you through setting up a simple Node.js backend with Express.js for routing and MongoDB (or any other database) for user management.

We'll use RESTful APIs to connect the front end (HTML) with the back end (Node.js). Here's how you can build the connection.

Step 1: Set Up Node.js Backend
Install Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, download it from here.

Create a Project Directory: Open your terminal/command prompt and create a directory for your project:

bash
Copy code
mkdir amazon-clone-backend
cd amazon-clone-backend
Initialize the Project: Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:

bash
Copy code
npm init -y
Install Required Packages: Install Express for handling routing and Mongoose to interact with MongoDB:

bash
Copy code
npm install express mongoose bcryptjs jsonwebtoken body-parser cors
Packages:

express: For creating routes and handling HTTP requests.
mongoose: For interacting with MongoDB (database).
bcryptjs: For password hashing.
jsonwebtoken: For handling JSON web tokens (user authentication).
body-parser: For parsing incoming request bodies.
cors: For enabling cross-origin requests (to connect front end and back end running on different ports).
Create the Backend Structure: Inside the project folder, create the following structure:

arduino
Copy code
amazon-clone-backend/
├── models/
│   └── User.js
├── routes/
│   └── auth.js
├── server.js
└── config/
    └── db.js
Step 2: Create the User Model
In the models folder, create a User.js file. This file will define the schema for storing users in MongoDB.
